## AutoHotKey script for fast switching between apps

### Usage
1. Activate the script through AHK
2. At any time press Ctrl+Win+Alt+Key (key = 0 to 9 or a to z). This stores current active window under Key
3. At any time press Win+Alt+Key (key = 0 to 9 or a to z). This brings back into focus the window that was stored under Key

Example:
- Open browser window
- Press Ctrl+Win+Alt+b
- Open some other app
- Press Win+Alt+b
- Now the focus is back to the browser

### The why
I built it as a productivity tool. Having a few reliable key bindings seems more efficient to me than using Alt-Tab and searching through tens of windows with mouse and arrow keys.
